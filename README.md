# Kamal Chilukuri Final Project

***Compiling:*** Simply run the make command to compile all files__

***Running:*** The executable is called main so the command is "./main"  


###Testing on sample_text-1.txt
- sample_text-1.txt has a filesize of 3345 bytes
- the encoded version has a filesize of 14483 bits or 1811 bytes
- Thus we get a compression ratio of 1.847

#### Limitations: 
- The tool does not work with any special ascii characters (i.e > 127)
- If the program encounters a special characer during importing it will output a message and ignore that character
- If the rool encounters a special character while encoding it will halt the process with an error message once encountered


Note: This tool has a --help command that can be used to view all commands
